<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 slices rye bread</li>
    <li>Â½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
    <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
    <li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
    <li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.</li>
    <li>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices, dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</li>
    <li>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</li>
